Some friendly advice to install Accumulo once Hadoop and Zookeeper are installed (in that order)


1. cd/usr/local
2. sudo wget http://apache.mirrors.tds.net/accumulo/1.4.5/accumulo-1.4.5-dist.tar.gz
**(note: the website has about 3 different accumulos i.e. 1.4.5 and 1.6.1 )
3. sudo tar xzf accumulo-1.4.5 accumulo
4. sudo chown -R {your username} accumulo
**I would assume it is cloudera if you are using a quickstart // ask it: whoami if you are uncertain
5. su - {your username}
6. cp /usr/local/accumulo/conf/examples/512MB/standalone/* /usr/local/accumulo/conf
7. vim /usr/local/accumulo/conf/accumulo-env.sh
  a. You should set your JAVA_HOME, HADOOP_HOME, and ZOOKEEPER_HOME path variables
    i. ie.
    
8. accumulo init

** keep reference to accumulo start and stop services
9. /user/local/accumulo/bin/start-all.sh

10. check to see it works! pull up a browser.  Or firefox <url> if you feel adventerous
